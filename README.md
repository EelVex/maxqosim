# maxqosim

`maxqosim` is a software package that facilitates the analysis and simulation
of quantum open systems, providing a framework where theoretical calculations,
efficient numerical calculations and exposition can be coordinated and
automated.
`maxqosim` consists of `Maxima` and `Fortran`  routines, revolving around the
symbolic manipulation of equations relevant to quantum open systems theory and
their efficient numerical simulation.
`maxqosim` package aims to be a tool for reproducible, extendable and efficient research
in quantum open systems.
